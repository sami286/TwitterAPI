# Unofficial Twitter Bot

Hi everyone! Let me present my first ever Open Source project 😋

The idea behind this project is to do all the cool things the Official Twitter API won't let you do.

Of course, use it at your own risk 😉


## STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
To use it you just simply have to:
1. Install Node if you haven't from `https://nodejs.org`
2. Clone (or download) this repo `git clone https://github.com/sami286/TwitterBot.git`
3. In the directory, run `npm install` to download all dependencies
4. Run `node index.js` to start the magic!
5. The program will guide you through the process from this point on 👍🏿


If you find any bug, feel free to submit an issue or send a PR 😝
